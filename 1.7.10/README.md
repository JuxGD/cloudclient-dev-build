.jar files from building https://github.com/CloudClientDev/cloudclient/tree/development/1.7.10/cloudclient as of February 4th, 2023, 17:45 CET.
To install, first make sure you have Forge 1.7.10 installed. Then, simply go into your mods folder, create a folder named 1.7.10 inside it, and put **cloud-1.7.jar** (NOT cloudmc-1.0-sources.jar) and any other 1.7.10 forge mods in the new folder.

You can build it yourself! Clone the repo from the development branch of the [official Cloud Client GitHub repo](https://github.com/CloudClientDev/cloudclient/tree/development) and follow the instructions for setting up the workspace (not step 6) and building.
